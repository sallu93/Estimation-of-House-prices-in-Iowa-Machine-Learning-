# Estimation-of-House-prices-in-Iowa-Machine-Learning-
Used Machine learning on WEKA to determine the best predictive model for house sale prices in Iowa using a historical database.

---> Analyzed sales prices of houses in Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010 using a machine learning software called WEKA.
---> Found a model to predict the house prices based on attributes describing the property.
---> Carried out data preprocessing - handling missing values, irrelevant attributes and skewed attributes. 





Software used in the project - WEKA
