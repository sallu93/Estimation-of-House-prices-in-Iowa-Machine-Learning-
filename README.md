# Prediction-of-House-prices-in-Ames, Iowa-Machine-Learning-
Used Machine learning on WEKA to determine the best predictive model for house sale prices in Iowa using a historical database of the sales prices of houses in Ames, Iowa.

-> Analyzed sales prices of houses in Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010 using a machine learning software called WEKA.

-> Found a model to predict the house prices based on attributes describing the property.

-> Carried out data preprocessing - handling missing values, irrelevant attributes and skewed attributes.
